# How to use?

- First, write your `git log` to a `.log` file.
- Then, run the program using `python main.py 'FULL PATH TO YOUR LOG FILE' ''`

This will create a default `deduplicated.json` in your path.

If you already have a `deduplicated.json` of your own, provide your file as a second command. For example:

`python main.py 'FULL PATH TO YOUR LOG FILE' 'FULL PATH TO YOUR DEDUPLICATED.JSON FILE'`
